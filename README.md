## Road Accident Analysis with SQL and Power BI

This repository explores road accident data to gain insights into patterns and contributing factors. The project utilizes SQL for data cleaning and manipulation, and Power BI for interactive data visualization.

### Key Features:

* **SQL Scripts:** Clean and transform road accident data using efficient SQL queries.
* **Power BI Dashboard:** Gain insights through interactive visualizations like charts and maps. Identify trends in:
    * **Accident Rates:** Analyze overall accident counts and casualty rates.
    * **Contributing Factors:** Explore accident causes like weather, vehicle type, and road conditions.
    * **Severity:** Understand the distribution of accidents by severity (fatal, serious injury, minor injury).
    * **Location:** Identify high-accident zones and pinpoint areas needing safety improvements.
    * **Time:**  Analyze trends based on time of day or day of week.

### Benefits:

* Understand the current state of road safety.
* Identify areas with high accident rates and contributing factors.
* Inform data-driven decision making for road safety initiatives.

This project provides a framework for analyzing road accident data and can be adapted to various datasets.
